PREREQUISITES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fortran compiler (I work with gfortran, and the codes have also been tested with ifort)
- LAPACK, installed with the same Fortran compiler as the codes will be (NOTE: you can
  compile a bunch of the codes without LAPACK, but if you want the complete package, you
  will need the LAPACK libraries)

COMPILING DIRECTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I did not think too hard about other users installing the software, so this process is a
little haphazard. Sorry. The simplest option that should work for most people is to run the
shell script called "simple_configure.sh" from the top directory:

./simple_configure.sh --interactive

If no command line inputs are specified, a usage statement is printed. The --interactive
flag will prompt you to enter your Fortran compiler, path to LAPACK (if present), and the
directory to place the executables.

This script checks that your compiler exists and LAPACK is present, then generates a
Makefile for compiling the software. Once this script is completed, you can install
the software into the designated directory with:

make
