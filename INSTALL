COMPILING DIRECTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New installation instructions!!!
Set up makefile with the script simple_configure.sh. This can be run
from the command line or interactively (using --interactive). After
running "simple_configure.sh", enter "make".

Old instructions, deprecated
To compile the codes, enter "make". This will compile and move the
executable codes into the directory ../bin/. By default, the Makefile
uses gfortran as the Fortran compiler. This can be modified by changing
the variable $(FC). If "make" notifies you that there is nothing to be
done, use "make clean" and then "make" again.
