PREREQUISITES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- GNU compilers
	- Available from most package managers
	- To use other compilers, you will need to modify CMakeLists.txt
- CMake
	- Version 3.12 or higher
	- Available from most package managers
	- Download CMake directly at: https://cmake.org/download
- Make
	- Standard on most *nix operating systems
- LAPACK
	- I use LAPACK version 3.9.0 but older versions should work fine
	- Available at: http://www.netlib.org/lapack
	- Hdef can be compiled without LAPACK; some programs will not work at all, and a few
	  others will have LAPACK-dependent options disabled
	- I recommend installing LAPACK with the same compilers as Hdef


COMPILING HDEF DIRECTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I did not think too hard about other users installing the software, so this process is a little
haphazard. Sorry. (It is better now than it was!)

!! NOTE: THERE IS NO LONGER A CONFIGURATION SCRIPT OR A MAKEFILE
!! HDEF IS NOW CONFIGURED AND BUILT WITH CMAKE!


1. Go to the Hdef directory in your terminal and make a new directory called build/.
   Change into the build/ directory:

		>> mkdir build
		>> cd build


2. Enter the following cmake command one one line, replacing the variables with the appropriate
   values for your environment:

		>> cmake \
			-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/hdef/installation/directory \
			-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=[/path/to/]gcc \
			-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=[/path/to/]gfortran \
			[-DLAPACK_LIB_DIR=/path/to/lapack] \
			..

   The following variables need to be defined with the CMake command line arguments in order for
   Hdef to be built and installed:
   - CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: location to install Hdef code
   - CMAKE_C_COMPILER: (path to) gcc
   - CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER: (path to) gfortran
   - LAPACK_LIB_DIR: path to LAPACK libraries (OPTIONAL)

   For example, on my machine I go to /Users/mherman2-local/Research/Hdef/build/ and type:

		>> cmake \
			-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.. \
			-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-10 \
			-DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran-10 \
			-DLAPACK_LIB_DIR=/Users/mherman2-local/Research/lapack-3.9.0 \
			..


3. Once cmake has finished configuring, type:

		>> make

   to compile the Hdef executables. Then type:

		>> make install

   to create the bin/, lib/, and test/ directories in the installation directory you specified,
   and copy the Hdef programs, libraries, and tests to these directories.


4. To test all subroutines and executables, go to the build/ directory and type:

		>> make test

   To test only the executables and see the standard output from the test scripts, go to the
   build/ directory and type:

		>> make test-exec

   If the codes are compiled and installed correctly, the tests *should* complete with no errors.
   However, the tests are still a bit of a work in progress. So please report testing issues to
   me if you run into them!
