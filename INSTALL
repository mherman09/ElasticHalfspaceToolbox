PREREQUISITES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fortran compiler
	- I work with gfortran. Some of the compiler configurations and options in the Makefile are
      gfortran specific, so use a different compiler at your own risk.
	- Gfortran can be installed with most package managers (Fink, Homebrew, MacPorts, APT, etc.).
	- You can also find gfortran at https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran.
- C compiler
	- A C compiler is required for the testing suite only. I use gcc, and in many (most?) cases, gcc
      comes with gfortran.
- LAPACK
	- LAPACK is required for the software that uses linear algebra (eigenanalysis, inversions).
	- The LAPACK 3.7.1 source code is included in the ext/ directory, per the LAPACK user license.
	- Hdef can still be compiled without LAPACK; some programs will not work at all, and a few
      others will have LAPACK-dependent options disabled.
	- Make sure that LAPACK is installed with the same compiler as Hdef.
	- Installing LAPACK is fairly easy on most systems:
		1. Unzip the LAPACK package. Change into the LAPACK directory.
		2. Copy make.inc.example to make.inc.
		3. Edit the Makefile so that the line "lib: blaslib variants lapacklib tmglib" is
           uncommented.
		4. Type "make".
	- NOTE: You may see the following error when compiling: "recipe for target lapack_testing
      failed". You may disregard this, or if you really want to run the tests, you can dive
      into OS memory management and type "ulimit -s unlimited" before running "make".


COMPILING HDEF DIRECTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I did not think too hard about other users installing the software, so this process is a little
haphazard. Sorry. THERE IS NO LONGER A CONFIGURATION SCRIPT! You now have to edit the Makefile
directly. You will need to check the following variables for your system:

	- CC: path to gcc
	- FC: path to gfortran
	- FOPT: gfortran optimization flags
	- INCLUDE_DIR: location to place and use .o and .mod files
	- BIN: location to put compiled executables
	- LAPACK_LIB_DIR: path to LAPACK libraries
	- LAPACK_LIB: names of static LAPACK libraries; check the LAPACK_LIB_DIR to see the specific
      names of the libraries: (ref)lapack, (ref)blas
	- CPP_LAPACK: compiler pre-processor for LAPACK; must be set to -DUSE_LAPACK to compile codes
      with LAPACK

Once you have set up these variables in the Makefile, type:

make

Unit tests of the modules and numerical tests of the executables are run with:

make test
