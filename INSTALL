PREREQUISITES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fortran compiler
	- I work with gfortran; the codes also work compiled with ifort
	- Gfortran can be installed with most package managers (Fink, Homebrew, MacPorts, APT, etc.)
	- You can also find gfortran at https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran
- LAPACK
	- LAPACK is required for the software that uses linear algebra (eigenanalysis, inversions)
	- The LAPACK 3.7.1 source code is included in the ext/ directory
	- A lot of Hdef can still be compiled without LAPACK if preferred
	- Make sure that LAPACK is installed with the same compiler as Hdef
	- Installing LAPACK is fairly easy on most systems:
		1. Unzip the LAPACK package. Change into the LAPACK directory.
		2. Copy make.inc.example to make.inc.
		3. Edit the Makefile so that the line "lib: blaslib variants lapacklib tmglib" is uncommented.
		4. Type "make".
	- NOTE: You may see the following error when compiling: "recipe for target lapack_testing failed"
	  You may disregard this, or if you really want to run the tests, you can dive into OS memory
	  management and type "ulimit -s unlimited" before running "make".

COMPILING HDEF DIRECTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I did not think too hard about other users installing the software, so this process is a little
haphazard. Sorry. The simplest option that should work for most people is to run the shell script
called "simple_configure.sh" in interactive mode from the top directory:

./simple_configure.sh --interactive

If no command line inputs are specified for the simple_configure script, a usage statement is
printed. The --interactive flag will prompt you to enter your Fortran compiler, the path to LAPACK
(if you have compiled the libraries), and the directory to place the executables.

This script checks that your compiler exists and LAPACK is present, then generates a Makefile for
compiling the software. Once this script is completed, you can install the software into the
designated directory with:

make
