PREREQUISITES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fortran compiler
	- I work with gfortran. Some of the compiler configurations and options in the Makefile are
      gfortran specific, so use a different compiler at your own risk.
	- Gfortran can be installed with most package managers (Fink, Homebrew, MacPorts, APT, etc.).
	- You can also find gfortran at https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortran.
- C compiler
	- A C compiler is now required! I use gcc, and in many (most?) cases, gcc comes with gfortran.
- LAPACK
	- LAPACK is required for the software that uses linear algebra (eigenanalysis, inversions).
	- The LAPACK 3.7.1 source code is included in the ext/ directory, per the LAPACK user license.
	- Hdef can still be compiled without LAPACK; some programs will not work at all, and a few
      others will have LAPACK-dependent options disabled.
	- Make sure that LAPACK is installed with the same compiler as Hdef.
	- Installing LAPACK is fairly easy on most systems:
		1. Unzip the LAPACK package. Change into the LAPACK directory.
		2. Copy make.inc.example to make.inc.
		3. Edit the Makefile so that the line "lib: blaslib variants lapacklib tmglib" is
           uncommented.
		4. Type "make".
	- NOTE: You may see the following error when compiling: "recipe for target lapack_testing
      failed". You may disregard this, or if you really want to run the tests, you can dive
      into OS memory management and type "ulimit -s unlimited" before running "make".


COMPILING HDEF DIRECTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I did not think too hard about other users installing the software, so this process is a little
haphazard. Sorry.

NOTE: THERE IS NO LONGER A CONFIGURATION SCRIPT! You now have to edit the Makefile directly!

1. Copy Makefile.tmpl to Makefile.

2. In the Makefile, you will need to check the following variables for your system (these are all
   at the top of the Makefile, within the first ~40 lines):

	- CC: (path to) gcc
	- FC: (path to) gfortran
	- FWARN: gfortran warning flags
	- FOPT: gfortran optimization flags
	- BIN_DIR: location to put compiled executables
	- INCLUDE_DIR: location to place and use .o and .mod files
	- LAPACK_LIB_DIR: path to LAPACK libraries (if using)
	- LAPACK_LIB: names of static LAPACK libraries; check the LAPACK_LIB_DIR to see the specific
      names of the libraries: (ref)lapack, (ref)blas (if using)
	- CPP_LAPACK: compiler pre-processor for LAPACK; must be set to -DUSE_LAPACK to compile codes
      with LAPACK

3. Once you have set up these variables in the Makefile for your system, type:

   make

   to compile the Hdef executables. If all goes well, these will be available in the BIN_DIR you
   specified in the Makefile.

4. Unit tests of the Hdef modules and numerical tests of the executables are run with:

   make test

   These *should* be set up to work correctly on all systems, i.e., if the codes are compiled and
   installed correctly, the tests should complete with no errors. However, the tests are still a bit
   of a work in progress. So please report testing issues to me if you run into them!
