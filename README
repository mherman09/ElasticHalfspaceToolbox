Hdef version 2019.06.01

The primary purpose for this suite of codes is the forward calculation of displacements, strains,
and stresses in an elastic half-space (hence, H(alfspace)def(ormation)...). The sources are fault
slip models, using the solutions derived in Okada (1992) and in Meade (2007). The main engines can
be found in the file okada92_module.f90 and tri_disloc_module.f90. Most of the programs are designed
to use these routines in a variety of seismological and geodetic applications.

There are also several other programs that I wrote as I came across other applications in
Geodynamics (so in that sense maybe Hdef stands for "Herman Deformation" toolbox). I got tired of
always rewriting and recalculating and looking up certain equations and typing them into my
calculator or Matlab, so I wrote some simple codes to have these results at my fingertips. These are
included, and you may find them useful as well.

Directions for installation are in the file INSTALL.
Tutorials can be found at my website: http://www.matthewwherman.com/software.html
Man pages for most of the programs and scripts are in the man/ directory.

There are no guarantees: happy? I think these results are correct, and I have used these codes to
make calculations for peer-reviewed publications, but I cannot guarantee that there are no bugs. If
you think you have found a bug, please report it to me at:

Feel free to change the codes and use them as you see fit. Please check out the LICENSE when you use
the software (it's the MIT license). There is no authoritative citation for the codes (yet), but the
first published papers using the software are:
