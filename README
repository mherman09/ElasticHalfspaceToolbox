The primary purpose for this suite of codes is the forward calculation
of displacements, strains, and stresses from fault slip models, using
the solutions derived in Okada (1992). The main engines can be found in
the file okada92subs.f, and most of the other programs are essentially
designed to use the subroutines in okada92subs.f in seismological or
geodetic applications.

There are also a few programs that I wrote as I came across various
applications as a Geodynamics student in graduate school. I got tired
of always looking up certain equations and typing them into my
calculator, so I wrote simple codes to have these results at my
fingertips. These are included, and you may find them useful as well.

GUARANTEES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are none. Happy? I think these results are correct, and I have
used them to make calculations for peer-reviewed publications, but I
cannot guarantee that there are no bugs. Feel free to change the codes
as you see fit. Check out the LICENSE (it's the MIT license).
