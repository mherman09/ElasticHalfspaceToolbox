README file for codes written by Matthew Herman.

COMPILING DIRECTIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To compile the codes, enter "make". This will compile and move the
executable codes into the directory ../bin/. By default, the Makefile
uses gfortran as the Fortran compiler. This can be modified by changing
the variable $(FC). If "make" notifies you that there is nothing to be
done, use "make clean" and then "make" again.


CODES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The primary purpose for this suite of codes is the forward calculation
of displacements, strains, and stresses from fault slip models, using
the solutions derived in Okada, 1992. The main engines can be found in
the file okada92subs.f, and most of the other programs are essentially
designed to use the subroutines in okada92subs.f with seismological or
geodetic finite fault models.

There are also a few programs that I wrote as I came across various
applications as a Geodynamics student in graduate school. I got tired
of always looking up certain equations and typing them into my
calculator, so I wrote simple codes to have these results at my
fingertips. These are included, and you may find them useful as well.

More recently, I have been working on inverting static displacement
data. This is mostly in fltinv.f. It is pretty crude, but it gets the
job done for my simple applications. The linear inversion option seems
to work reasonably well. The simulated annealing option is not working
to my satisfaction yet (as of May 19, 2016).


GUARANTEES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are none. Happy? I think these results are correct, and I have
used them to make calculations for peer-reviewed publications, but I
cannot guarantee that there are no bugs. Feel free to change the codes
as you see fit. Check out the LICENSE (it's the MIT license).
