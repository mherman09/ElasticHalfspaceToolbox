Hdef version 1.2.0

The primary purpose for this suite of codes is the forward calculation of
displacements, strains, and stresses in an elastic half-space (hence,
H(alfspace)def(ormation)...). The sources are fault slip models, using the
solutions derived in Okada (1992). The main engines can be found in the file
okada92subs.f, and most of the other programs are designed to apply the
subroutines in okada92subs.f in seismological or geodetic utilities.

There are also programs that I wrote as I came across other applications in
Geodynamics. I got tired of always rewriting and recalculating and looking up
certain equations and typing them into my calculator or Matlab, so I wrote some
simple codes to have these results at my fingertips. These are included, and you
may find them useful as well.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are no guarantees: happy? I think these results are correct, and I have
used these codes to make calculations for peer-reviewed publications, but I
cannot guarantee that there are no bugs. If you think you have found a bug,
please report it to me at:

Feel free to change the codes and use them as you see fit. Please check out the
LICENSE when you use the software (it's the MIT license). There is no
authoritative citation for the codes (yet), but the first published papers using
the software are:
